# Q-Learning Dynamics, Multi-stage Games and Applications

## Introduction

This is a repository containing all code and plots for use in my final project for Dynamics of Learning and Iterated Games.
All code is written by me or is attributed to the original author in the Appendix.

## Usage

The base `QLD` module is provided as an installable Python package. You may install this by downloading the repository, navigating to the folder you saved the repository into in a command prompt, and running `python -m pip install -e .`
